# DiscordBotCode

Description:

This is a personal project that was intended to be a Twitch.tv Chat bot.
The bot is pretty simple it has a preset list of commands that allow users of a discord to load into a queue system, Display the help prompt, remove the user from the exsisting queue, and more stuff to hopefully be coming.
